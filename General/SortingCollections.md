# Sorting collections

A common requirement in software engineering is to sort collections. This page provides information on how to sort collections in Pharo.

## Sorting API

Pharo's Collections come with an API to sort them. In this section, we will present some of it and explain their difference.

The default sorting implemented on Pharo's collection is a merge sort. Merge sort worst-case complexity is `O(N log N)`. This sorting algorithm usually does only half as many comparisons as heapsort or quicksort.

### Sort a collection 

The two main methods to sort a collection are `#sort:` and `#sorted:`. Those two methods are taking a block or a sort function as parameter (those are explained later in this page) and return a collection sorted based on the parameter.
The difference between the two methods is that `#sort:` sort the receiver when the `#sorted:` method sorts a copy of the receiver.

```Smalltalk
#(1 2 4 7 3 6 4) sort: #yourself ascending. "#(1 2 3 4 4 6 7) <= This result is the receiver"
#(1 2 4 7 3 6 4) sorted: #yourself ascending. "#(1 2 3 4 4 6 7) <= This result is a copy of the receiver"
```

Those two methods also have an equivalent without argument, `#sort` and `#sorted` that sort the collection using the `#<=` comparison operator.

The API described here will sort a collection at one point but new elements added to the collection will not be sorted. If you wish to keep a collection sorted, you should use `SortedCollection` as explained in the next section.

> Warning: If not absolutely needed, one should not use `SortedCollection` because it might impact performances of your software when adding and removing items to the collection.

### Keep a collection sorted

In case you want to keep a collection sorted, you should use a `SortedCollection`. This collection is configured with a sort block or sort function and will sort all new elements added to the collection.

You can transform a collection into sorted collection using `#asSortedCollection:` or `#asSortedCollection`. 

```Smalltalk
(#(1 2 4 7 3 6 4) asSortedCollection: #yourself ascending)
	add: 2;
	yourself "a SortedCollection(1 2 2 3 4 4 6 7)"
```

You can also instantiate yourself the sorted collection:

```Smalltalk
(SortedCollection sortUsing: #yourself ascending)
	addAll: #(1 2 4 7 3 6 4);
	yourself "a SortedCollection(1 2 3 4 4 6 7)"
```

```Smalltalk
(SortedCollection sortBlock: [ :a :b | a < b ])
	addAll: #(1 2 4 7 3 6 4);
	yourself "a SortedCollection(1 2 3 4 4 6 7)"
```

> Note: #sortUsing: was introduced in Pharo 8. In previous versions it is possible to use #sortBlock: for both sort block and sort functions.

## Sort functions

The first way to sort a collection is to use a sort function. A sort function is an object configuring how to sort a collection. They can be created in different ways and can be composed. 

You can create a sort function using a property and a direction:

```Smalltalk
#('longstring' 'test' 'test2') sorted: #size ascending. "#('test' 'test2' 'longstring')"
#('longstring' 'test' 'test2') sorted: [ :string | string size ] descending "#('longstring' 'test2' 'test')"
```

```Smalltalk
#(#(1 2) #(2 3) #(0 0)) sorted: [:sequence | sequence inject: 0 into: [:sum :each | sum + each] ] descending. "#(#(2 3) #(1 2) #(0 0))"
```

You can use 2 arguments blocks, for cases where the function isn't expressible with objects that respond to `<` and `=`. The only catch is that such a function should return true or false, but a collation order instead, values of -1 (for before), 0 (the same) or 1 (to follow). For example:

```Smalltalk
| oddBlock |
oddBlock := [ :a :b | a odd = b odd ifTrue: [ 0 ] ifFalse: [ a odd ifTrue: [ -1 ] ifFalse: [ 1 ] ] ].
#(1 5 1 3 2 7 9 4 6) asSortedCollection: oddBlock descending	"a SortedCollection(6 2 4 3 1 7 9 5 1)"
```

Since Pharo 8, it is also possible to express the previous sort function using a property returning a boolean:

```Smalltalk
#(1 5 1 3 2 7 9 4 6) asSortedCollection: #odd ascending	"a SortedCollection(6 2 4 3 1 7 9 5 1)"
```

In this case, the elements answering `false` will be placed before the elements answering true in the ascending order. This is explained by the fact that the function will sort the booleans according to their bit value (0 or 1).

> If you wish to use this feature in a version earlier than Pharo 8, you can add this method as an [extension](Extensions.md) of the Boolean class:

```Smalltalk
threeWayCompareTo: anotherObject
	^ self asBit threeWayCompareTo: anotherObject asBit
```

Using #undefinedFirst and #undefinedLast it is possible to deal with nil values, moving them first or last. For Example:

```Smalltalk
#(a nil z b) sorted: #value ascending undefinedFirst. "#(nil #a #b #z)"
#(a nil z b) sorted: #value ascending undefinedLast. "#(#a #b #z nil)"
```

Finally, you can use a chained sorted function in case you have elements of the same priority in the first sort function.

In this next example, we sort by size and for elements of same size we sort by alphabetical order:

```Smalltalk
#('test' 'toto1' 'test2' 'toto') sorted: #size ascending, #yourself ascending "#('test' 'toto' 'test2' 'toto1')"
```

## Sorting via a block

The second way to sort a collection is to use a sort block. A sort block takes two elements of the collection as parameter and should return a boolean describing if the first one should be before the second one.

```Smalltalk
#('longstring' 'test' 'test2') sorted: [ :string1 :string2 | string1 size < string2 size ]. "#('test' 'test2' 'longstring')"
```
